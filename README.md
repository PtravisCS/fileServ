# FileStore

FileStore is my personal file upload/download/viewing program used to manage files on my server.
This project is 40% practical, 50% me testing things out, and 10% me having fun.

This program is being run on an Apache2 server with Mysql as the database engine.
This is a constant work in progress and is infrequently updated when I think up a new feature or improvement.
